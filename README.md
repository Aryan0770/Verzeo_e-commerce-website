HELLO EVERYONE,
So this is Aryan Mishra. A prefinal year graduate from KIIT university, bhubaneshwar.


In this project I have created a website where I sell some course, prouducts and its basically an e-commerce app.
To make this projects I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the framework used here is React. This is been done under the supervision of teachers in Verzeo where I have completed my training as well as frontend web developer.



To implement this project we can simply download the project folder and then follow the steps:
1. Open a new terminal.
2. Write npm install and then npm start
 After this it will open a browser and on local host 3000 it will open the web page!
